part A: 
1 pt for derivative
1 pt for all roots
-1 arithmatic errors

part B:
1 pt for each function.  
-1 for python errors where math is correct

part C:
1 pt any plot with both functions shown (correct values or not).  
1 pt for legend shown with correct labels. 
- .5 for swapping labels

part D:
1 pt "x +/- gradient" in any form.  
.5 pt, subtracting gradient. 
.5 pt, scaling gradient by learn_rate

part E:
2 pt: loop which takes 4 gradient descent steps
1 pt: print pts to command line (in order)
1 pt: plot which shows grad descent steps and function
NOTE: students may struggle with python structure here, please be specific with your feedback so that they learn programming structure

part F: 
1 pt: we haven't reached the global min of f.  
1 pt: point for any correct ideas about how we might change parameters to head to the global minimum.  We're looking to encourage students to play with the graph they just created.  

part G:
2 pts for each function
-1 or -.5 for python errors

part H:
1 pt "x +/- gradient" in any form.  
.5 pt, subtracting gradient.  
.5 pt, scaling gradient by learn_rate

part G (... the second one):
2 pt: loop which takes 4 gradient descent steps
1 pt: print pts to command line (in order)
1 pt: plot which shows grad descent steps and function
NOTE: again, students may struggle with python structure here, please be specific with your feedback so that they learn programming structure
