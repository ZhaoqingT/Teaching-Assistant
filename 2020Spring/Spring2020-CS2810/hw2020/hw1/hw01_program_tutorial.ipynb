(Python 2.x is not compatible in several ways, and we won't accept Python 2 code in this course to streamline grading.)  Python installs come in a few varieties; we recommend Anaconda (follow the link) because it comes with several packages we'll use, as well as the useful Jupyter notebook utility.  If you already have Python installed, other installs are fine as long as you are willing to install packages as necessary (numpy and matplotlib are needed now, scipy.stats likely down the road)."

Vim, Emacs, and Atom are all examples of this, but not Word (which inserts hidden Word-specific formatting) or Notepad (it'll do but it's not meant for programming).  Alternately, you could try using the PyCharm IDE (Integrated Development Environment) if you prefer working in the context of an IDE (similar to DrRacket or IntelliJ).  But that's not strictly necessary for development - all we need is to open a text file and call it .py instead of .txt.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just as Java has libraries with useful functions, Python does as well, which are brought in with the `import` keyword.  A lot of what people like about Python is the fact that it has great libraries for things like linear algebra, statistics, displaying data, and even more advanced stuff like natural language processing and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common libraries to use is numpy (for \"Numerical Python\").  This contains essentials like matrix multiplication (numpy.matmul).  Notice the convention of libraryname.functionname.  If you just say `import mylibrary`, you'll still need to refer to functions with the library name followed by a dot, like `mylibrary.myfunction`, which is Python's way of keeping functions from different libraries straight.  You might think this would start to drive you nuts, and it can, a little.  However, if you say `import mylibrary as ml`, then you've just defined a shorthand that you can use instead of the full library name (`ml.myfunction`).  The shorthand can be whatever you want, but it should typically at least share a starting letter with the full library name, and some are conventional (`np` for `numpy`).\n",

Often, Googling isn't a bad way to go to determine which libraries will help you (try Googling `Python dot product` and see if it works; notice that the top real hit is more useful than the hit-or-miss WebAnswers box at the top, which sadly has a habit of catapulting less-good results to the prestigious @1 position).

You can create a 1D array that acts as a vector with numpy.array, which takes a list of numbers as an argument - or it can take a list of lists and return a 2D array that can represent a matrix.
