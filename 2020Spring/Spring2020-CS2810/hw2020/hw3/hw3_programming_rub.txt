Part A:
(1 pt) describe span of A as whole 2d plane
(1 pt) describe span of B as a 1d line (-1/2 pt for describing wrong line, no loss of credit for not specifying line)
(1 pt) linear dependence causes B to only span a line

Part B:
(1 pt) describe span of C as whole 3d volume
(1 pt) describe span of D as a 2d plane within 3d volume (no need to specify plane)
(2 pt) D is only 2d because its columns are linearly dependent

Part C:
(1 pt) E is a 3x3 matrix
(1 pt) rank of E is not 3
(1 pt) rank of E is 2

basis of null space
(1 pt) row reducing E
(2 pt) identifying [1 -2 1] as basis vector (or any multiple)

basis of column space
(2 pts) identifying column vectors of E as basis of column space
(1 pt) expressing as a matrix appropriately

Evaluate if each of the plots represent the span of the bases the student gives.  If a correct picture of an incorrect basis is given, then full credit should be earned for the plot.  However, remove a point if the dimensionality of the plot doesn't match what it should (the null space should be 1d and the column space should be 2d).

(.5 pt) any scatter plot
(2 pt) scatter plot corresponds to given basis
(2 pt) red vector shown consistent with basis
